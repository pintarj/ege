# EGE ~ Entrex Game Engine
EGE is a game engine in early development. It opens a fullscreen window,
it prepares an OpenGL 4+ context and it starts your scenario.

### What it can do?
Currently (at version 0.1.0) it can't do much:

    * draw in low-level using an OpenGL-like system (more or less)
    * check if a keyboard key is pressed (only inputs for now)

**Have fun, Janez.**
